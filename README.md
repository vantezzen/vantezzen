## Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Bennett! I'm a software developer developing web-apps and other web-based projects. I open-source a lot of my software so you can see it here on GitHub :octocat:.

Some interesting projects I'm working on:
- [Skip Silence](https://github.com/vantezzen/skip-silence): A browser extension that skips silent parts of a video
- [minimalpedia](https://github.com/vantezzen/minimalpedia): A minimalistic frontend for Wikipedia using React
- [Ferdi](https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi): An app for managing all your messaging services

Find me on the web 🌍:
